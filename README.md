# D-Stream
Implementation of the D-Stream clustering algorithm for use in MOA. An earlier version is included as part of the MOA 17.06 release. A user-provided parameter to specify the grid width for numeric attributes has been added.

The D-Stream algorithm is described by Yixin Chen and Li Tu in their paper "Density-Based Clustering for Real-Time Stream Data" [2]. Please cite that paper if you use this code.

MOA (Massive Online Analysis) [1] is a Java-based, open source framework for data stream mining. More details can be found on its [website](http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) and it can be found on GitHub as well (https://github.com/waikato/moa).
